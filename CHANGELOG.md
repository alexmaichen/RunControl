# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [Unreleased]

- Support for high heat features- Benefits Package, Jury Summons, and Approval Process.
- Support for Anvils.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-17

To use it, the user must have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.

### Added
- RC_Maker.py, a tool written in Python using the tkinter library.

### Changed
- HOWTO.md to reflect this alternative.

Third full release! This version contains some minor fixes compared to RC1.

### Added

- There's now an AlwaysEligible field in the theseusEncounter data type.
- Updated HOWTO.md to explain the new 1.2.0 features.

### Fixed

- Wells with only one forced item can no longer show duplicates of that item.

*...plus changes from 1.2.0-RC1*

## [1.2.0-RC1] - 2023-12-01

This update adds several features for better configurability and ease of run creation, as well as several bug fixes and under-the-hood refactors. If no critical bugs are found, this will be released as 1.2.0.

### Added

- Option for special rooms (fountain, story, shop, midboss) to only appear if forced.
- Option for rarities to only be forced when eligible (e.g., Common boons won't appear when you have a Yarn).
- Option for gold pots to only be forced up to the maximum amount a room allows.
- Encounters can now specify enemy types and wave counts, rather than having to include exact spawn counts.
- Runs can now specify which God Theseus should summon.
- RunControl is now compatible with extensions like StartingBuildMod.
- A specific God can now be forced in chamber 1, just like in other chambers.

### Changed

- The wells and pools in midbiomes will now appear even if a run does not force them. (They can still be forced not to appear.)
- Encounters/Bosses have now been split into a new menu page, separate from Rooms/Rewards.
- Sell wells will now infer the value of a boon if none is specified, instead of defaulting to 0.

### Fixed

- Wells and shops will no longer fail to force items if their data has gaps (e.g. if you specify items 1 and 3 but not 2).
- You can now force Chaos gates not to appear, even if you have a Light of Ixion.
- Rare Crop will no longer fail to appear when forced.
- Fixed some errors in ExampleRun.lua.
- The default rarity setting will no longer cause hammers to have rarity.

## [1.1.0] - 2023-10-04

This is a smaller update, which doesn't add many new features to the runs themselves, but adds a little more polish to 1.0.0 (plus some new options).

### Added

- Interface/QOL settings page.
- Option to always show chamber number in the top-right.

- Wells will no longer occasionally have an incorrect item after rerolling.

- Indexing Gods by appearanceNum will now work correctly in Styx shop.
- Forcing an empty slot as the only Boon from a God will no longer cause a crash.

### Added

- BoonControl now has fields for BlessingValue, CurseValue, and CurseLength of Chaos boons.
- RoomControl now has fields for EligibleRooms and ForcedRooms, e.g. when a standard combat or miniboss was on a door. Note that this can only narrow the pool of rooms, not widen it.

- SellControl and ShopControl now have FillWithEligible config options.
- RewardControl, RoomControl, and ShopControl now have CheckEligibility config options. These can be bypassed with the AlwaysEligible field.

### Changed

- RewardControl can now force specific gods to appear in Trials.

### Added

- RewardControl now supports a startingReward data type to set the reward given in chamber 1.
- RewardControl now supports setting rooms to be elite encounters.
- RoomControl now supports setting laurel colour for rooms.
- BoonControl has a new config feature called FillWithEligible; if this is enabled, any empty slots in a boon menu will be filled with eligible boons from the vanilla menu.
- BoonControl now supports replace boons. Also added a config option to either infer that a boon is a replace (based on whether we already have the slot filled), or require it to be specified.
- EncounterControl now supports a lernieEncounter data type. Currently, this is quite primitive, but it still allows setting the colour of the main and side heads.
- ShopControl now allows you to specify the contents of a Fateful Twist.

### Changed

- Run files now allow you to sort by dataType in a single central table, rather than requiring sub-tables for each mod. This shrinks the files slightly and makes them much more readable.
